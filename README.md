Generating Image Summaries from Chapter Text in a Digital Manuscript

This project investigates how textual content in a
manuscript chapter can be computationally analyzed to generate a meaningful description or
caption for an accompanying image. The goal is to explore the thematic connection between
text and illustration and evaluate whether automated summarization and keyword extraction
techniques can assist in manuscript image metadata creation.

Digital Approach: The project will begin by selecting 1–2 chapters from the Greek
manuscript that contain both textual content and related images. The chapter texts will be
transcribed or extracted from the digital manuscript source. The transcription will be cleaned
and prepared for analysis.
Next, the text will be processed using digital text analysis techniques:
 Keyword extraction and thematic analysis: Using tools like Voyant Tools, highfrequency words and key themes will be identified in the Greek text. Since automatic
tools have limited support for ancient or medieval Greek, manual review and
assistance from AI language models (such as ChatGPT) will complement this step.
 Automated summarization: The chapter text will be summarized using GPT-based
language models, which can generate concise summaries in Greek or English. This
summary will serve as a textual representation of the chapter’s core content.
 Caption generation for images: Based on extracted keywords and summaries, short
descriptive captions for the manuscript’s images will be generated. These captions
aim to reflect the content and themes of the text visually represented by the images.
 Comparison and reflection: The generated captions will be compared to the actual
images to evaluate how well the text-based summaries represent the visual content.
This will provide insight into the relationship between text and image in the
manuscript and the utility of digital tools in manuscript studies.
Finally, the project will present the results as a combined digital document or simple web
interface showcasing images, chapter texts, and the generated summaries and captions,
illustrating the digital approach's effectiveness.
